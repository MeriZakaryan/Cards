                        the
                        founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by King Argishti I at the western extreme of the

                    <h2>Sevan</h2>
                    <p>Lake Sevan is the largest body of water in both Armenia and the Caucasus region. It is one of the
                        largest freshwater high-altitude (alpine) lakes in Eurasia. The lake is situated in Gegharkunik
                        Province, at an altitude of 1,900 m (6,234 ft) above sea level. The total surface area of its
                        basin
                        is about 5,000 km2 (1,900 sq mi), which makes up ​1⁄6 of Armenia's territory.[7] The lake itself
                        is
                        1,242 km2 (480 sq mi), and the volume is 32.8 km3 (7.9 cu mi). It is fed by 28 rivers and
                        streams.
                        Only 10% of the incoming water is drained by the Hrazdan River, while the remaining 90%
                        evaporates.The lake provides some 90% of the fish and 80% of the crayfish catch of Armenia.
                        Sevan
                        has significant economic, cultural, and recreational value. Its sole major island (now a
                        peninsula)
                        is home to a medieval monastery.</p>
